# Neighbors
The best way to find the nearest neighbors of any address in the US.

## Requirements

No external packages. Just remember to `npm install` before using.

## Usage

Simple as can be! `node test.js [address]` will do the trick. For example, `node test.js '750 Virginia Park Street, Detroit, MI 48202'` will print off 743, 750, 759, and 760 as the nearest neighbors.
